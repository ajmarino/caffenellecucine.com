We saw fresh bread that came out of the oven and we could not resist. The place is nice and clean and we were treated wery well. I took a menu and after we looked it over we decided we have to go for lunch, everything looks good and also clean. You can't go wrong, there is something for everyone. We were glad to find this place and will tell our friends.",
